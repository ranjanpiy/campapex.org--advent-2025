Grandma Kelly noticed that some Village Tasks are being marked as 'Completed' without anyone actually being assigned to them! This doesn't make sense - how can a task be done if nobody was assigned to do it? She needs your help to add a validation rule.

Before You Begin
Create a record-triggered automation that prevents Village Tasks from being marked as Completed without an assigned villager.

Requirements
Trigger Event: Before a Village Task is inserted or updated
Conditions: Status = 'Completed' AND Assigned Character is blank
Action: Prevent the save and display an error message
Error Message: "Cannot complete a task without assigning it to a villager first."
Examples
Example 1:

Insert: Village Task with Status = 'Completed', no Assigned Character
Result: Insert is blocked with error message
Example 2:

Update: Change existing task from Status = 'In Progress' to Status = 'Completed', but Assigned Character is blank
Result: Update is blocked with error message
Example 3:

Insert: Village Task with Status = 'Completed', Assigned Character = 'Ginger Claus'
Result: Task is saved successfully
Example 4:

Insert: Village Task with Status = 'Not Started', no Assigned Character
Result: Task is saved successfully (validation only applies to Completed status)
Notes
Use a Before Insert and Before Update trigger
Use addError() to display the error and prevent the save
Validation should apply to both new records and updates
Tasks with any other Status ('Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Blocked') can be saved without an assignment
Handle bulk operations properly
