Task Auto-Assignment by Type
Grandma Kelly wants to streamline task assignment in the Family Support App. Instead of manually assigning every Village Task to a villager, she wants the system to automatically assign tasks based on their Task Type. Each villager has their specialty!

Before You Begin

Before you start building, make sure you:

Install the managed package in your org to create the sObjects, Apps, and Permission Sets you need for this challenge.
Assign yourself the "Family Support Manager" Permission Set from the package
Search for and open the "Family Support" app in the App Explorer. There you'll find the sObjects we'll be working with.
You'll complete this challenge in your connected Salesforce org. You can use Apex Trigger, or Record-Triggered Flows to implement the required automation.
Once you think your solution is working, come back here and click "Run Tests" to see how you did.

Create a record-triggered automation that automatically assigns Village Tasks to the right villager based on the Task Type.

Requirements
Trigger Event: Before a Village Task is inserted
Conditions: Task Type is populated
Action: Set the Assigned Character based on Task Type:
Task Type = 'Cook / Deliver Meal' → Assigned Character = 'Ginger Claus'
Task Type = 'Build / Fix' → Assigned Character = 'Stella Pinewood'
Task Type = 'Health & Safety Check' → Assigned Character = 'Dr. Grace Evergreen'
Task Type = 'Decorate' → Assigned Character = 'Poppy Wintergold'
Task Type = 'Garden / Outdoor' → Assigned Character = 'Ivy Evergreen'
For all other Task Types, do not set Assigned Character
Examples
Example 1:

Insert: Village Task with Task Type = 'Cook / Deliver Meal'
Result: Task is saved with Assigned Character = 'Ginger Claus'
Example 2:

Insert: Village Task with Task Type = 'Build / Fix'
Result: Task is saved with Assigned Character = 'Stella Pinewood'
Example 3:

Insert: Village Task with Task Type = 'Music / Lullaby'
Result: Task is saved with no Assigned Character (field remains blank)
Example 4:

Insert: 3 Village Tasks with different Task Types in bulk
Result: Each task is automatically assigned to the correct villager based on its Task Type
Notes
Use a Before Insert trigger to set the field value before the record is saved
Only set Assigned Character for the specific Task Types listed above
If the Task Type doesn't match any of the listed types, leave Assigned Character blank
Handle bulk operations properly (multiple records at once)
If Assigned Character is already set manually, respect that value (don't overwrite it)
